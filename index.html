          <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>
          <p>I've been developing skills to quickly code user friendly, intelligent, elegantly designed websites</p>

        <section class="skill">
          <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
          <p>I write code that conforms to the W3C's web standards and semantic best practices. I use technologies like HTML5 / Jade, SASS, Javascript and jQuery, to transform static artwork into mobile first, pixel prefect, interactive and fully functional interfaces; exactly the way your designers intend them to be.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="skill">
          <h2>Responsive Web Development</h2>
          <p>How will we ensure your website looks great on multiple devices; including those that haven't even been invented yet? I build using a responsive grid system mobile first. I have experience with frameworks such as Bootstrap and Bourbon Neat and am practiced with flex box. All of these technologies ensure sure that layouts are now quicker, smarter and more future-proof.</p>

          <h2>Design and Fine Arts Integrated with User Experience</h2>
          <p>My education in fine arts and design help me compose beautiful creative sites that direct and aide the users' experience. I know Sketch and inVision and can create wireframes for client and developer projects. I also enjoy creating icons, logos and other assets with Sketch and Adobe.</p>

              <h1>Arcana Tarot</h1>
              <p>This website provides users with a tarot card reading anywhere and anytime. I used the project to polish my javascript, jQuery, Sass, and Sketch skills. All of the content is design and produced my me; inculding the logo, icons, card backs and card fronts.  I drew all of the assets in Sketch. <br>This is any ongoing project at the moment. I'm still working on the card front images and am polishing the sophistication of the javascript logic. My goal is to write javascript that will provide readings based on parsing the users input. I am also refining the animations. </p>
