                <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
                <p>I write code that conforms to the W3C's web standards and semantic best practices. I use technologies like HTML5 / Jade, CSS3 (SASS), Javascript and jQuery, to transform static artwork into mobile first, pixel prefect, interactive and fully functional interfaces; exactly the way your designers intend them to be.</p>

                <h2>Responsive Web Development</h2>
                <p>How will we ensure your website looks great on multiple devices; including those that haven't even been invented yet? I build using a responsive grid system mobile first. I have experience with frontend frameworks such as Foundation, Bootstrap and Bourbon Neat ensure that layouts are now quicker, smarter, standardised and more future-proof.</p>
